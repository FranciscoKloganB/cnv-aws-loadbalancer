         * time was spend drawing the actual data (not on the axes or tick marks).
         * Since the Graphics2D has a drawImage method that can do scaling, we are
         * using that instead of scaling it ourselves. We only need to draw the
         * data into the bufferedImage on startup, or if the data or gradient
         * changes. This saves us an enormous amount of time. Thanks to
         * Josh Hayes-Sheen (grey@grevian.org) for the suggestion and initial code
         * to use the BufferedImage technique.
         *
         * Since the scaling of the data plot will be handled by the drawImage in
         * paintComponent, we take the easy way out and draw our bufferedImage with
         * 1 pixel per data point. Too bad there isn't a setPixel method in the
         * Graphics2D class, it seems a bit silly to fill a rectangle just to set a
         * single pixel...
         *
         * This function should be called whenever the data or the gradient changes.
